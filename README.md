C                        G7
Should tensor dim be denied

    C                F
And cause a fatal error

       C                 G7
Should I lose my mind, my dear? Should I lose my mind?

Am          F    G7   C
I'll comment out the working code and start afresh next time.

F   C         G7
O tensor dim, o tensor dim, will I lose my mind?

    C         F
What is the correct input shape???  Is the tensor still 2d?

      C            G7

    Am      F    G7   C
    
 O tensor dim, O tensor dim, I'll get you right in time.
